# Alasdair Penman Code

This github repository contains a variety of programs I have made.  Many for ICPC competition practice as well as Google CodeJam. 

The programs sport a solution to a "billards" practice ICPC problem, a Knapsack algorithm, Prims algorithm, an iterative solution to creating N nested loops, an "enemy ship" program which demonstrates the use of structs, a program which solves a "Bangladesh Flag" Google CodeJam question, and a binary search algorithm.

You can also enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe, but you must be aware that you cannot win as the AI is to strong.  I have also included the beginnings of a chess program, for the moment it displays a chess board to the terminal screen and you can move the pieces.  The AI is currently under development.
