# Alasdair Penman Code

This github repository contains a variety of programs I have made.  Many are for the ICPC 
competition practice as well as Google CodeJam. 

The programs sport a solution to a "billards" practice ICPC problem, an iterative solution 
to creating N nested loops, an "enemy ship" program which demonstrates the use of structs, 
a program which solves a "Bangladesh Flag" Google CodeJam question, plus a Bullseye Google 
CodeJam question.

You may also enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe, but you must be aware that you cannot win because
 the AI is to strong.  I have also included the beginnings of a chess program, for now
 it displays a chess board to the terminal screen and you can move the pieces.  The AI is 
currently under development.
